# Regular-expressions

Regular expressions (regexes) provide a way to identify strings that
match a specified pattern. They are extremely useful for preprocessing
text and extracting results from high-performance computing and data
science workloads. These materials accompany the COMPLECS training
topic *Using Regular Expressions with Linux Tools* where, primarily in
the context of the Linux grep utility, we incrementally introduce the
main features of regexes: string literals, specifying multiple
characters, quantifiers, wildcards, anchors, character classes,
grouping, and alternation. We also explore more advanced topics such
as word boundaries, lazy and greedy matching, regex flavors (basic,
extended, and Perl compatible), regexes with awk and sed, searching
compressed files, and using large language models (LLMs) to create
regexes.

A working knowledge of grep, and optionally awk and sed, will help you
make the most of this session. We recommend attending the COMPLECS
*Linux Tools for File Processing* webinar or reviewing the associated
materials (recording, slides, GitHub repo) if you are not familiar
with these topics.

## About COMPLECS

COMPLECS (COMPrehensive Learning for end-users to Effectively utilize
CyberinfraStructure) is a new SDSC program where training will cover
non-programming skills needed to effectively use
supercomputers. Topics include parallel computing concepts, Linux
tools and bash scripting, security, batch computing, how to get help,
data management and interactive computing. COMPLECS is supported by
NSF award 2320934.
