# Regular-expressions

Regular expressions (regexes) provide a way to identify strings that match a specified pattern. They are extremely useful for preprocessing text and extracting results from high-performance computing and data science workloads. These materials accompany the COMPLECS training topic *Using Regular Expressions with Linux Tools* where, primarily in the context of the Linux grep utility, we incrementally introduce the main features of regexes: string literals, specifying multiple characters, quantifiers, wildcards, anchors, character classes, grouping, and alternation. We also explore more advanced topics such as word boundaries, lazy and greedy matching, regex flavors (basic, extended, and Perl compatible), regexes with awk and sed, searching compressed files, and using large language models (LLMs) to create regexes.

A working knowledge of grep, and optionally awk and sed, will help you make the most of this session. We recommend attending the COMPLECS *Linux Tools for File Processing* webinar or reviewing the associated materials (recording, slides, GitHub repo) if you are not familiar with these topics. 

## About COMPLECS

COMPLECS (COMPrehensive Learning for end-users to Effectively utilize CyberinfraStructure) is a new SDSC program where training will cover non-programming skills needed to effectively use supercomputers. Topics include parallel computing concepts, Linux tools and bash scripting, security, batch computing, how to get help, data management and interactive computing. COMPLECS is supported by NSF award 2320934.
