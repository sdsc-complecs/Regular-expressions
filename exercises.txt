This file contains some suggested exercises to help you master the
material covered in the COMPLECS "Using Regular Expressions with Linux
Tools" training.

(1) Work through all the examples from the presentation and make sure
that you understand what the regexes are doing.

(2) The best way to learn regexes is to apply them to your own
problems. Think of a data processing task, such as filtering a data
set or parsing the output of a calculation, where a regex would help
you simplify your work.

(3) Write a grep one-liner that will match phone numbers of the forms

    (i) (xxx) xxx-xxxx
    (ii) xxx-xxx-xxxx

You can start by handling each of the two formats separately and
ignoring additional characters that may be adjacent to the number
(e.g., "(555) 555-1234x" or "x555-555-1234"), then combine into a
single regex using alternation and proper handling of word boundaries.

(4) Write a grep one-liner that will find amino acid sequences of the
following form. Optionally use -o option to output just the match.

C
8-17 upper case letters
W
38-47 upper case letters
one letter from the list ACFILMV

(5) Modify the previous one-liner to limit to valid amino acids (upper
case letters minus BJOUXZ)

C
8-17 standard amino acids
W
38-47 standard amino acids
one letter from the list ACFILMV
